                        Sophia at ITU's AI for Good Global Summit in Geneva in May 2018
                        Sophia is a social humanoid robot developed by Hong Kong-based company Hanson Robotics. Sophia was activated on April 19, 2015[1] and made her first public appearance at South by Southwest Festival (SXSW) in mid-March 2016 in Austin, Texas, United States.[2] She is able to display more than 50 facial expressions.
                        Sophia has been covered by media around the globe and has participated in many high-profile interviews. In October 2017, Sophia, the robot became the first robot to receive citizenship of any country.[3][4] In November 2017, Sophia was named the United Nations Development Programme's first ever Innovation Champion, and the first non-human to be given any United Nations title.[5]<br/>

                        <h4>History</h4>
                        Sophia was activated on April 19, 2015.[6] The robot, modeled after actress Audrey Hepburn,[7] is known for her human-like appearance and behavior compared to previous robotic variants. According to the manufacturer, David Hanson, Sophia uses artificial intelligence, visual data processing and facial recognition. Sophia also imitates human gestures and facial expressions and is able to answer certain questions and to make simple conversations on predefined topics (e.g. on the weather).[8] Sophia uses voice recognition (speech-to-text) technology from Alphabet Inc. (parent company of Google) and is designed to get smarter over time.[6] Sophia's intelligence software is designed by SingularityNET.[9] The AI program analyses conversations and extracts data that allows her to improve responses in the future.[10]
                        Hanson designed Sophia to be a suitable companion for the elderly at nursing homes, or to help crowds at large events or parks. He has said that he hopes that the robot can ultimately interact with other humans sufficiently to gain social skills.[3]
                        Sophia has seven robot humanoid “siblings” who were also created by Hanson Robotics.[11] Fellow Hanson robots are Alice, Albert Einstein Hubo, BINA48, Han, Jules, Professor Einstein, Philip K. Dick Android, Zeno,[11] and Joey Chaotic.[12]
